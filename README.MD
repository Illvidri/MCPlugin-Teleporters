# Teleporters | Minecraft Plugin | Latest Version 0.0.1
### Made by Illvidri
</br>

### About:
This plugin was adapted from a datapack I had made which allowed for the creation of teleporters, since plugins are less resource intensive on the minecraft client than datapacks are.

The coordinates can be input using stained glass blocks in the correct configuration.

There are two settings for the large teleporters: Absolute coordinate teleportation; Relative coordinate teleportation.
